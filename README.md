### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hung, an IT student of [RMIT Vietnam](https://www.rmit.edu.vn). I like web development and mobile as well. 
Since 2019, I have created 2 small websites: project management and Covid-19 tracking map.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [LaCa](https://github.com/dzuy811/laca), [Uncle HungHung](https://github.com/hungthezorba/Uncle-HungHung).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java and some web technologies for my projects.
